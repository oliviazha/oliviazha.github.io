                <p>I worked with 3 other designers to design this app experience for the Adobe x Activision Creative Jam Challenge over the course of one weekend. 
                    The Activision challenge prompt was as follows:<br> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Create a proficiency-focused app experience to inform new gamers about video games based on age-appropriateness and skills 
                    such as read-ing, hand-eye coordination, fitness, personal account-ability, multi-tasking, problem-solving, memory, attention, concentration, social skills and more. 
                    This third-party mobile app must help: <br> 
                    ‍• Young kids learn and share new discoveries with their friends, or <br>
                    ‍• Parents find age-appropriate skills and games for their children, or <br>
                    • Adults discover games that fit their interests and time allotted, or <br>
                    • Senior citizens identify games to connect to friends and family"

            <h2>01 | OVERVIEW</h2> <br>
            <p> ‍Due to COVID-19, gaming traffic increased significantly. 
                The surge of new gamers brought to light the sheer number of gaming choices in the market and the lack of a single resource to help gamers determine the games right for them and their situation. 
                We kept this context in mind throughout the process, aiming to design a solution that would specifically solve the needs of this new influx of gamers.
            </p> 
            <h3> ‍What is GameScouts? </h3> <br>
            <p>
                ‍GameScouts is the mobile app concept my teammates and I designed for this challenge, targeted towards adult gamers seeking to discover new games and better integrate gaming into their daily lives and social networks. 
                The app is not intended to be a new storefront for smartphone game sales. Instead, it focuses on discovery of all types of video games (not limited to smartphone) based on a user's skill proficiency and individual situation. 
                Additionally, GameScouts is designed to allow for sharing personal game achievements and building or maintaining connections through gaming.
            </p>


            <h2>02 | TARGET USER </h2> <br>
            <p> ‍We first discussed the target audience options, ultimately deciding to focus on building an app directed towards adults to help them "discover games that fit their interests and time allotted". 
                This was the audience segment that we felt we could resonate the most with, given only a short period of time to research the user.
            </p> 
            <p>
                ‍User needs we kept in mind: <br>
                - beginner-friendly interface for users who are trying out gaming for the first time <br>
                - gaming integration into existing social circle <br>
                - tailored recommendations that fit personal schedule <br>
            </p>


            <!-- <h2>03 | COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS </h2> <br>
            <p> ‍I did some research of the gaming-related platforms that already exist to gain a better understanding 
                of the gaming industry and how other platforms already address gamer needs.
            </p> 


            <div class="grid-container">   
                <div id="col">
                    <h3> ‍Steam </h3> 
                    <h4> ‍online distribution platform that allows for the playing, creating, and discussing of PC games</h4> <br>
                    <p>
                        ‍STEAM includes several notable features like Steam Chat, Broadcast, Artwork, Workshops, Market etc. I think STEAM does a great job of being a sort of one-stop shop for PC games, 
                        especially for experienced gamers. However, for casual gamers or new gamers, the amount of varying content, community forums, and options on STEAM could be overwhelming. 
                        Moreover, there is no way to self-filter search feed content or explore non-PC video games on STEAM. 
                        Users have to go through game discussion forums to learn about more specific game details like estimated time per play or skills required.

                <div id="col">
                    <h3> Twitch </h3> 
                    <h4> ‍‍live streaming video platform gamers use to stream their games for others to watch</h4> <br>
                    <p>
                        ‍The success of Twitch as a live-streaming platform in the gaming industry is evidence for the importance of "realness" and authentic content in gaming. 
                        The real-time chat function and live video concept show that users find value in real-time interactions with others in the gaming community.

                <div id="col">
                    <h3> Discord </h3> 
                    <h4> ‍‍‍communication platform allowing gamers to connect directly via voice, video, or text, and join servers where larger communities can interact together</h4> <br>
                    <p>
                        ‍Though Discord's services aren't limited to gamers, the platform is particularly popular in the gaming community for its partnership with Youtube streamers and other gaming softwares like Twitch. 
                        Users can integrate Discord with their Xbox or PlayStation accounts. 
                        On top of this, its UI is similar to other communication platforms like Slack, allowing easy transition for users of these other services.

            <h2>04 | CORE FEATURES IDEATION </h2> <br>
            <p> ‍My teammates and I brainstormed and discussed the key features that our app experience should have. Below is a description for the main features we decided on:
            </p> 
            <h3> ‍FEATURE 01: Customized Game Recommendations and Exploration </h3>  -->
<!--             
            <h3> Pain Point: </h3> <p> Adults have limited time for gaming and wish to discover new games that fit their individual interests and schedules </p> 
            <h3> Design Goal: </h3> <p> Reduce the amount of time users spend looking for games to play by providing tailored game recommendations and a filtering search feature </p> 
            <h3> What will this look like? </h3>  <p >There will be a page dedicated to exploring new games, featuring customized game recommendations, most popular games, and what a user's friends are playing. The search function will have a filtering section that allows the user to limit search results according to topics like genre, skills used, and average time per play.
            </p> -->
